              <h4>So here's a little about me and this blog.</h4>
<p>I'm fairly new to formal programming. In the past, I had dabbled in Access and Excel and played with VBA and SQL.  I always loved the logic of it.  But recently, I decided to jump fully into programming. I found a great mentor and was advised to start with Python. </p>
<p>I got a few books and was directed to some awesome websites and of course the Python docs. And then got started.</p>
<p>Many of those resources were great.  And some were more confusing than useful - at least to me.  </p>
<p>And then, I had the most wonderful opportunity to be accepted to the Hacker School program in Fall 2014. On the <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School website</a>, they call it a 'retreat for programmers', and it was. For 12 weeks, I was fully immersed in programming - with great facilitators and mentors who assisted and guided me through the many questions I had.  I also got to work with fellow Hacker Schoolers in peer programming. And there were lots of break out discussions and workshops and resources.  I will probably write more about the Hacker School experience.</p>
<p>And this blog is about sharing some of those discussions - so that someone else may benefit.  I will write my blog in the way that I learned. Lots of practical application of the many different methods and libraries and all. With lots of explanations of what the code means and links for further reading.</p>
<p>I'm always learning, so your comments are helpful.</p>
