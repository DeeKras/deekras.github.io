Title: Finding Longitude & Latitude based on IP

####Once I had the IP, I needed to find the longitude & latitude coordinates

On that [recent project](http://www.deekras.com/my-first-python-project-and-what-i-learned.html) I was working on, I was looking for the local weather based on where the user is located. So first, [I got the IP](http://www.deekras.com/get-the-public-ip-of-users-computer.html). With that IP, I used **pygeoip.GeoIP** to find the longitude and latitude coordinates.  Later, I will use those coordinates to find the local weather.

First, I downloaded the GeoIP data from [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygeoip/](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygeoip/) and unzipped it. And saved the GeoLiteCity.dat on my local server. `'/path/GeoLiteCity.dat'`.

I also had to `pip install pygeoip`.

Here's the code:

```python
import pygeoip   

geoip_data = pygeoip.GeoIP('/path/GeoLiteCity.dat')

def find_lat_lng(ip):
        data = geoip_data.record_by_addr(ip)
        lat = data['latitude']
        lng = data['longitude']
        return lat, lng
```

`data`:  In this case, I used the **record_by_addr(addr)** attribute since I had the addr, the IP. And I want the full record.  
There are many other attributes you can use with this geoip data. Checkout more at: [http://pygeoip.readthedocs.org/en/v0.3.2/api-reference.html](http://pygeoip.readthedocs.org/en/v0.3.2/api-reference.html)

`data` is a dictionary. And I called the `latitude` and `longitude` keys of `data` to find the values of `lat` and `lng`.

With the `lat` and `lng`, I will be able to get the weather for those coordinates. Using **forecast_io**. More on that next time.
