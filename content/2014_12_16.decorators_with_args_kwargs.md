##Decorators: Decorators - with \*args and \**kwargs

This post builds on my previous one about [Decorators](http://www.deekras.com/working-with-decorators.html).

So we have the decorator that 'prettifies' the date returned from the original function.

```python

def pretty_date(func):
    def wrapper():
        print 'getting the date from function: {}'.format(func.__name__)
        date = func()
        print 'got the date: {} (before it was formatted)'.format(date)
        return '{0:%Y}_{0:%m}_{0:%d}'.format(date)
    return wrapper

```

This `@pretty_date` decorator can be used with **any function** that returns a date, no matter how that date is calculated. As long as it is in a format that the `return '{0:%Y}_{0:%m}_{0:%d}'.format(date)` can evaluate.

But what if the original function needs some arguments in order for it to get the date?  Yes, those arguments can be passed through the decorator to the function.  It's rather simple. Just use \*args and \**kwargs.  [Read more about \*args and \**kwargs.](http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2008/01/how-to-use-args-and-kwargs-in-python/)

Let's say we have this function:

```python

from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def date_into_future(date, days):
    date_format = "%m/%d/%Y"
    a = datetime.strptime(date, date_format)
    return a + timedelta(days=days)

```
It has 2 arguments: a `date` and numbers of `days` into the future.   All it does is add the number of days to the original date. And then later we want to 'prettify' it with the `@pretty_date` decorator.


Or we have this function:

```python

from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@pretty_date
def date_in_past(month, day, days, year=2014):
    date = '{}/{}/{}'.format(month, day, year)
    date_format = "%m/%d/%Y"
    a = datetime.strptime(date, date_format)
    return a - timedelta(days=days)

```
This function has 4 arguments. The first 3 are positional, the last is a keyword argument. OK, this is just for <strike>argument</strike> learning sake.  This function gets a date and subtracts a number of days from it. And then of course, we want to 'prettify' it.

These and the other functions from the previous post all can be decorated with the same `@pretty_date` decorator.  But since they all have different amounts of args and even kwargs, we have to design the decorator to be able to handle all possible functions that might be wrapped by it.

Here's the revised decorator:

```python

def pretty_date(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print 'getting the date from function: {}'.format(func.__name__)
        date = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print 'the date: {} (before it was formatted)'.format(date)
        return '{0:%Y}_{0:%m}_{0:%d}'.format(date)
    return wrapper

```

Notice the `*args` and `**kwargs` in the `def wrapper(*args, **kwargs)` and again in the `date = func(*args, **kwargs)`.  They are included in the wrapper and then passed to the original function. Which of course uses those arguments to get the date.

And that's it!  You can use this decorator with many different functions - whether they do or do not have `args` or `kwargs`.

Here's how you might call these 2 functions. (Remember, once the functions are wrapped with the decorator, they are always wrapped. So when we call the function, they are automatically decorated.)

```python

print date_into_future('12/8/2014', 30)
print date_in_past(year=2014, month=1, day=10, days=30)
print date_in_past(2, 28, 45, year=2014)

```

And the results:

```python

getting the date from function: date_into_future
the date: 2015-01-07 00:00:00 (before it was formatted)
2015_01_07


getting the date from function: date_in_past
the date: 2013-12-11 00:00:00 (before it was formatted)
2013_12_11


getting the date from function: date_in_past
the date: 2014-01-14 00:00:00 (before it was formatted)
2014_01_14
```
