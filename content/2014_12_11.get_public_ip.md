Title: Get the public IP of user's computer

####Here's how to get the IP

For a [recent project](http://www.deekras.com/my-first-python-project-and-what-i-learned.html), I needed to get the longitude and latitude of where the user was at the time.  And from that data, I could get the local weather.

To do that, I'd find her local IP and then later use  **pygeoip.GeoIP** to find the coordinates of that IP. (That's another post)

First, I used:

```python
ip = request.remote_addr
```

`request.remote_addr`: `request` is part of the [Flask module](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/) that i was using to create this web application. In very short, the `request` 'remembers' the value of what we were requesting. Check out the [request class of Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#incoming-request-data).

Then a fellow HackerSchooler pointed out that sometimes that might get my local host (127.0.0.1) and not the IP as I thought I might get. 

The suggestion was:

- First attempt to get the IP that way, since it is more 'resources efficient'.
- Also have an `if` statement to check if it did indeed get me that local host.
- And if it is the localhost, then use `icanhazip.com` to get the IP.

So here is the code:

```python

import requests  #import the request module

def get_ip():
    ip = request.remote_addr
    if ip == '127.0.0.1':
        ip = requests.get("http://icanhazip.com/").content
    return ip

```

`requests.get`:  the `ip` is the response. It is the `content` from the `get` request to `"http://icanhazip.com/"`.
