##Maps

**First: What is 'map'?**

In very short, `map` runs the given function over the given iterable.

For example: We have a function that converts years to their Roman numeral version. And we have a list of years. We can run a `map(convert_year_to_roman_numeral, ['1999', '1776', '2015']`.  This will run the function `convert_year_to_roman_numeral` on the list of years. And return the Roman numerals for those years. As a list.



**The Syntax**

`map(function, iterable)`

   - The function can be a function or a lambda expression.

   - The iterable can be any iterable - list, string, etc. 


--------------------------------------

**A few examples:**

`map(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3, 4])`

   - The function here is a lambda.
   - The iterable is the list.
   - This runs the lambda (x**2) on the first item in the iterable - on the `1`.
   - Then runs the lambda on the next item in the iterable, and so on. Until all items have been run.
   - The result is `[1, 4, 9, 16]`



```python
    def sqr(num):
        return num **2
    seq = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    
    map(sqr,seq)
```

   - This runs exactly as above.
   - It runs the `sqr` function on the `seq`. And run the function on every item in the iterable.
