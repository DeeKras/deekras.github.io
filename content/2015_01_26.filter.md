##Filter

**First: What is 'filter'?**

In very short, `filter` runs the given function over the given iterable and only returns those that are true.

For example: We have a function that returns only those items in the list that are integers.



**The Syntax**

`filter(function, iterable)`

   - The function can be a function or a lambda expression.

   - The iterable can be any iterable - list, string, etc. 



--------------------------------------

**A few examples:**

All these examples use this list: `list = [1, 2, 3,"A", 11, "C", 12, 13, 14]`


**1. **  `filter(lambda x: type(x) is str, list)`

['A', 'C']


**2. ** `filter(lambda x: x<10, list)`

[1, 2, 3]

**3. ** `filter(lambda x: type(x) is int, list)`

[1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14]


**4. ** `filter(lambda x: type(x) is int and int(x)%2==0, list)`

[2, 12, 14]


**5. ** `filter(lambda x: x%2==0, filter(lambda x: type(x) is int, list))`

 The inner filter returns all integers as a list. then the outer filter runs on that filtered list.

 [2, 12, 14]
