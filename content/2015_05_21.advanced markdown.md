**Escapes**

Markdown provides backslash (\\) escapes for the following characters:

\   backslash
`   backtick
*   asterisk
_   underscore
{}  curly braces
[]  square brackets
()  parentheses
#   hash mark
+   plus sign
-   minus sign (hyphen)
.   dot
!   exclamation mark

There are other characters that backslash cannot escape. For those you can use the ascii
|   "&#124;"
^   "&#94;"

For example:   
    - **Pipe (|)**  If you are trying to put a pipe into a table (tables are created using pipes), it could cause problems, so you might use the "&#124;" instead.
    - **Caret (^)**  Sometimes, the caret is used to make a superscript, like an exponent. But if you are trying to display the actual caret as in **set1^set2**, you can also write it as **set1&#94;set2**

**Linebreaks**  

End a line with two spaces to add a `<br/>` linebreak:
