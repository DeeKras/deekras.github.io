###Advanced markdown

~~Scratch this.~~

Of course, there is the basic markdown docs like this one from [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/). Or this [one](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or this [one](http://warpedvisions.org/projects/markdown-cheat-sheet/).  
But as I writing my posts for this blog or for reddit, I encountered challenges that those basic docs didn't address. So I googled further and found some solutions. I share here:

####Escapes

Markdown provides backslash (\\) escapes for the following characters:

|char | name|
|:-|:-|
|\\|   backslash  
|\`|   backtick  
|\*|   asterisk  
|\_|   underscore  
|\{\}|  curly braces  
|\[\]|  square brackets  
|\(\)|  parentheses  
|\# |  hash mark  
|\+ |  plus sign  
|\- |  minus sign (hyphen)  
|\. |  dot  
|\! |  exclamation mark  

There are other characters that backslash cannot escape. For those you can use the ascii  
|   `&#124;`  
^   `&#94;`  
~   `&#126;`



For example:  

**Pipe (|)**  
    - If you are trying to put a pipe into a table (tables are created using pipes), it could cause problems, so you might use the `&#124;` instead, as `set1&#124;set2`.

**Caret (^)**  
    - Sometimes, the caret is used to make a superscript, like an exponent. But if you are trying to display the actual caret as in **set1^set2**, you can also write it as `set1&#94;set2`

**Tilde (~)**
    - In Markdown, the tilde creates a <strike>strikethrough</strike>.  If you want to display the tilde, you can write it as `&#126;&#126;Scratch this.&#126;&#126;`


####Linebreaks 
End a line with two spaces to add a `<br/>` linebreak:

####Bookmarks/ Anchors
Mark the spot where you'd like the anchor/ bookmark like so: `<a name="requests">requests module </a>`.  
And to refer to it, you'd write it like any link:  
`[previous post](http://www.deekras.com/using-a-weather-api-forecastio.html#requests)`
In the actual link, at the end, you add the `#name_of_bookmark`.

####Markdown for Reddit**  
http://reddittext.com/

**what's interesting specifically for reddit**  
   -  **Code **    Four or more leading spaces will display as code, and will scroll rather than wrap.
